Project Description:

365 Finance is a lightweight, mobile-first decentralized wallet application focused on the Solana blockchain.
It allows users to send, receive, and swap testnet SPL tokens including USD, EUR, and NGN tokens â€” with a clean, gold-and-luxury-black themed interface optimized for fast interaction.

Work Completed (Proof of Work):

Wallet Created on Solana Devnet

Three SPL Tokens minted successfully:

USD Token

EUR Token

NGN Token

Testnet SOL loaded into wallet

Mobile Application built using React Native + Expo

Two Main Screens:

Home Tab showing wallet balances + 3 main actions: Send, Receive, Swap

Profile Tab for user info/settings (placeholder)


Send, Receive, and Swap Screens functional (UI setup complete):

Send: Input recipient address and amount

Receive: Display own wallet address with QR code

Swap: Input from-token, to-token, and amount

Screenshots Included:

Home Screen (Wallet Balance)

Send Token Screen

Receive Token Screen

Swap Token Screen

Technology Used:

Frontend: React Native (Expo)

Wallet: Phantom Wallet (Testnet)

Blockchain: Solana Devnet

Token Tools: Orion Tools (for minting test tokens)

Future Improvements (Next Steps):

Connect app directly to Solana blockchain for real transaction signing

Implement real-time balance updates

Enable actual token transfer and swap operations

Add login with wallet feature (WalletConnect or Phantom)

Enhance profile screen with settings and transaction history

Improve UX with animations and better navigation flow

Move to Mainnet after successful testing

Summary:

365 Finance demonstrates a functional foundation for a mobile-based decentralized finance (DeFi) app, aimed at making token management easy, smooth, and elegant on Solana blockchain.

The project is ready for next-phase development once grant funding is secured.
